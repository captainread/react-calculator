## Project summary

This small calculator app was built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The calculator functionality relies on a held state to track
- what number(s) the user has inputted;
- what calculation they would like to perform;
- what the current result to be displayed is. 

Simple mathematical functions are triggered to calculate results.

While originally styled using basic CSS, the project has since been updated to utilise [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/).
